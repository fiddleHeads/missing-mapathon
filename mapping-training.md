# Mapping in OSM

In order to contribute mapping to a particular task in Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, we first have to [sign up](https://tasks.hotosm.org/?sort_by=priority&direction=asc&search=missing+maps) for an account.

You will have to fill out your information, agree to terms and conditions, and receive a confirmation email to get started.

Once you've received your confirmation email, log in and grant access.

The way this works is that various organizations around the world request mapping help from HOT OSM, and some of these tasks are more urgent than others.

You can [Explore Projects](https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore) in order to pick one to work on.

In our case, because we have a group of people gathered, we will work on one project in order to try and make a significant contribution in the time we have together tonight.

We have pre-selected a [project](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/9142) to map buildings in Jamaica impacted by the hurricane season and the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic. You can also find this project by searching by Project Number, which is 9142.

Before we get started, let's watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSLe6rjtgi0) of adding buildings in OpenStreetMap. We've already signed into our accounts, so we'll start one minute in.
