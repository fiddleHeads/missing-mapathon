Missing Maps is a collaborative project in which volunteers help map areas around the world missing from or underrepresented on maps in order to help in disaster relief efforts.

We use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) because all data and underlying maps are free and available to download for anyone.

OpenStreetMap is also dedicated to humanitarian mapping and maintains a platform and task manager allowing contributors from anywhere in the world to select a humanitarian mapping task to work toward fulfilling specific mapping needs in a particular area. This is called Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, or [HOT OSM](https://www.hotosm.org/) for short.
